## Working Norms

### Code Quality
- ✓ TypeScript strict mode (catch bugs early)
- ✓ Component-driven design (reusable, testable)
- ✓ Semantic HTML (SEO, accessibility)
- ✓ Consistent naming (camelCase for JS, kebab-case for CSS classes)
- ✓ Meaningful commit messages ("Add product detail page" not "fix")

### Content Management
- ✓ Single source of truth (lib/content.ts)
- ✓ Data-driven components (render from JSON, not hard-coded HTML)
- ✓ Avoid duplication (link, don't copy-paste)
- ✓ Update dates on content changes (freshness signal for SEO)

### Design & Animation
- ✓ Purpose-driven motion (no animation just for looks)
- ✓ 60 FPS target (use GPU-accelerated properties)
- ✓ Accessibility first (respect prefers-reduced-motion)
- ✓ Brand consistency (use Tailwind tokens, not inline colors)

### Performance
- ✓ WebP images, lazy-load by default
- ✓ Code split by route (each page loads only its code)
- ✓ Monitor bundle size (aim for <200KB per route)
- ✓ Lighthouse 90+ (performance, accessibility, SEO)

### SEO & Content
