        'Sodium metabisulphite (SMBS, Na₂S₂O₅) is one of the most widely used reagents for cyanide destruction in gold and silver processing. As leached tailings move to the detox circuit, residual free and WAD (weak-acid-dissociable) cyanide must be reduced to environmentally compliant levels before discharge - and SMBS, often paired with a copper catalyst and air, is the workhorse chemistry for the SO₂/air (Inco) process.',

      { heading: 'Why SMBS over liquid SO₂', paragraphs: [
        'For most African mine sites, importing and storing liquid SO₂ is impractical. SMBS is a stable, free-flowing powder that releases SO₂ in solution on demand, making it far easier to ship in 25 kg bags or jumbo bags, store in a warehouse, and dose with standard equipment. This logistical simplicity is why SMBS dominates demand across Tanzania, Zambia, DRC, and Ghana.',
      ]},
      { heading: 'Typical dosage', paragraphs: [
        'Dosage depends on the cyanide load, but a common starting point is roughly 2.5–5 kg of SMBS per kg of cyanide to be destroyed, optimised on site through bench testing. The reaction is catalysed by copper (often added as copper sulphate) and requires controlled aeration and pH (around 8–9) for efficient oxidation of cyanide to cyanate.',

        'PAC is a pre-hydrolysed coagulant that works across a wider pH band, requires lower doses, and produces less sludge than alum.
